# \:mechanical\_arm: Flex Development

> **Doing the heavy lifting so you don't have to 😉**

<br/>

I'm Lex ([@unicornware][unicornware]), a self-taught UI designer, full stack engineer, and software developer 👋🏾

A self-proclaimed digital solutionist, I'm also the brains and brawn behind Flex Development, a design and development
company dedicated to crafting high quality digital products.

I have experience designing web and mobile products, implementing user interfaces, building APIs and backend
integrations, as well as developing custom software. Over the years, I've worked with a slew of technologies and teams
of all sizes to deliver projects that have gone on to reach thousands.

What we can create together:

- Visual sitemaps, design comps, and prototypes
- Design systems and UI kits
- Landing pages, web sites, and web applications
- Web APIs and custom backend integrations
- Custom software packages

Don't see what you're looking for? No worries. **If you can dream it, I can build it. \:brown\_heart:**
